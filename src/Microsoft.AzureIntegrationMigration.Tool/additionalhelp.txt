    aim assess -v

  Don't abort at the first exception by a stage runner:
    aim assess --no-abort

    aim assess --no-abort --abort-stage Discover

    aim assess -f "C:\findpath1" -f "C:\findpath2"

  Change the default pattern for finding stage runners:
    aim assess -p *MyStageRunners.dll

  Change the working folder:
    aim assess -w "C:\temp"

  Save state before and after each stage runner:
    aim assess --save-state

  Save state before and after each stage:

  Change the path where state will be stored:
    aim assess -s "C:\temp\state" --save-state

  Change the default Azure Integration Services target:
    aim migrate --target Ise

  Export the model during an assessment:
    aim assess -o "C:\temp\model.json"
