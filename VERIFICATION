VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist Chocolatey moderators and the Chocolatey community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

This package contains a number of assemblies (DLL) files, along with dependent files.
This file lists their SHA256 checksums.

There is no other source for installation of these files, other than Chocolatey: 
The files are built and packaged and uploaded to Chocolatey; other than referenced files (e.g. .NET Core), they do not currently reside in any other public source.
Therefore, it is not possible to download an installer to compare checksums.

However, the checksums in here are generated as part of the build process,
and reflect the files that are packaged and submitted to Chocolatey.

It is still worthwhile comparing the checksums in this file to the ones for the files that have been installed by Chocolatey on your local system.

You can use one of the following methods to obtain the checksum from a local file:
  - Use powershell function 'Get-Filehash'
  - Use chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'

File 'LICENSE.txt' is obtained from <https://github.com/Azure/aimtool/blob/main/LICENSE>
